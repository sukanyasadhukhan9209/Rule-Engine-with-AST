# Rule Engine Application

## Overview

The Rule Engine Application is designed to evaluate user eligibility based on specific attributes, such as age, department, salary, and experience. It employs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to dynamically create, combine, and evaluate conditional rules.



## Features

- **Create Rules:** Define rules using a string format that gets converted into an AST.
  


- **Combine Rules:** Combine multiple rules into a single AST for more complex evaluations.
  

  
- **Evaluate Rules:** Check if the given data meets the criteria defined by the AST.
  


- **Tree Visualization:** Define or Combine Rule would should show Tree Representation.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/sukanyasadhukhan9209/Rule-Engine-with-AST.git"
   cd rule-engine
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. **Start MongoDB**

   Ensure that MongoDB is running on your local machine:

   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**

   ```bash
   nodemon server.js
   ```

## API Endpoints

1. **Create a Rule**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/create_rule`
   - **Method:** POST
   - **Body:**

     ```json
     {
       "ruleString": "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)",
       "ruleName": "Rule 1"
     }
     ```
use appropriate spaces in Rules for correct results.

Rule should be in follow format:
variable operator value 

   - **Response:**

     ```json
     {
       "_id": "605c72ef1f4e3a001f4d2e9a",
       "rule_name": "Rule1",
       "rule_ast": { ... }
     }
     ```

2. **Combine Rules**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/rules/combine_rules`
   - **Method:** POST
   - **Body:**

     ```json
     {
       "ruleIds": ["605c72ef1f4e3a001f4d2e9a", "605c730f1f4e3a001f4d2e9b"]
       "operators: op
     }
     ```

       "left": { ... },
       "right": { ... }
     }
     ```

3. **Evaluate a Rule**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/rules/evaluate_rule`
   - **Method:** POST
   - **Body:**

     ```json
     {
       "rule": { ... },
